## [1.3.8] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Gateway collector lost traffic after counter resets** 🐛
  - When a backend restarted or a connection ID was reused, `Math.max(0, delta)` silently discarded the traffic, and because the high-water mark was never reset, all subsequent traffic kept being swallowed until counters exceeded the old values. Now matches the Surge collector: resets are detected, current totals are counted as new traffic, and resets are logged
  - Fixed long-lived idle connections being evicted as stale after 5 minutes and then re-added as "new", double-counting their full cumulative totals — connections present in the feed now always refresh `lastSeen` and the counter watermark
- **Graceful shutdown could lose buffered data** 🐛
  - `APIServer.stop()` didn't `await app.close()`, and the synchronous `shutdown()` called `process.exit(0)` before the `onClose` hook could flush pending agent buffers; the whole chain is now awaited
- **WebSocket dead-client leak**: clients whose socket is already closed are now removed from the client map when a broadcast send fails, instead of being re-broadcast forever
- **Memory bounds**: realtime store now evicts the outer per-source-IP device detail maps (cap 10,000); WebSocket summary cache has a hard 1,000-entry cap; agent request-ID dedup map is pruned on a timer instead of a size-modulo check
- **Web frontend**
  - Login-confirm `setTimeout` was never cleared on unmount
  - Dashboard derived the locale by regex-parsing the pathname; now uses `useLocale()` from next-intl
  - Traffic chart hardcoded `en-US` time formatting and stat cards called `toLocaleString()` without a locale, producing inconsistent formats after switching languages
- **Shared package**: `parseGatewayRule` now validates object inputs at runtime so it can no longer return `proxy: undefined` in violation of its type contract
- **Go agent**: `syncConfig` read `lastConfigHash` without holding the mutex (TOCTOU); the policy sync loop's startup delay now responds to context cancellation; lock file permissions tightened to 0600; `json.Marshal` errors are no longer ignored
- **install.sh**: `download_file` unconditionally returned 0, masking download failures; curl/wget now have timeouts and retries (connect 10s / total 120s / 3 retries)

### Security

- **Configurable CORS**: new `CORS_ORIGIN` env var (comma-separated) restricts allowed origins; default stays permissive for LAN deployments
- **API security headers**: added `X-Content-Type-Options` / `X-Frame-Options` / `Referrer-Policy`
- **Constant-time token comparison**: agent token and dashboard token verification now use `crypto.timingSafeEqual`
- **Backend URL scheme validation**: only `http(s)` / `ws(s)` / `agent://` are accepted; dangerous schemes like `file:` are rejected
- **Persistent cookie secret**: when `COOKIE_SECRET` is not configured, the generated secret is persisted in the database so restarts no longer invalidate all sessions

### Changed

- **Dependencies upgraded across the board**: TypeScript 6.0, ESLint 10 (collector), better-sqlite3 12, recharts 3, react-day-picker 10, lucide-react 1.x, tailwind-merge 3, dotenv 17, Next.js 16.2.7, and more — all at latest; the web app stays on ESLint 9 until `eslint-plugin-react` supports v10

## [1.3.7] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **SQLite retention policy silently disabled** 🐛 ([#66](https://github.com/foru17/neko-master/issues/66))
  - Fixed `autoCleanup` defaulting to `false` on fresh installs: when no row exists in `app_config`, the DB read returned `false` instead of the declared default `true`, so minute-level and hourly stats tables were never pruned
  - Fixed `backend_health_logs` never being cleaned up: the startup flow used an inline `runAutoCleanup` that only covered `minute_*` / `hourly_*` tables; the real `CleanupService` (which handles health logs) was never instantiated
  - Fixed UI autoCleanup toggle not taking effect: `CleanupService.start()` used to early-return when `autoCleanup=false`, so the timer was never scheduled and subsequent toggles had no effect
  - Added env-var overrides: `SQLITE_RETENTION_MINUTE_DAYS` / `SQLITE_RETENTION_HOURLY_DAYS` / `SQLITE_RETENTION_HEALTH_LOG_DAYS` for set-and-forget Docker Compose deployments
  - Thanks to @airobot-bot for the detailed row-level measurements

- **Backend URL silently rewritten on edit** 🐛 ([#65](https://github.com/foru17/neko-master/issues/65))
  - Fixed an issue where editing any field of a backend (including token-only changes) would rebuild the URL from `host` / `port` / `ssl`, silently dropping any path, query string, or embedded credentials present in the original URL
  - Fix: when `host` / `port` / `ssl` haven't been touched, the original URL is preserved as-is
  - Collector now logs the specific fields that changed when restarting a collector (e.g. `changed: token`), so users can self-verify from logs that the reconcile loop picked up their change
  - Thanks to @yuhongwei380 for the report

## [1.3.6] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **WebSocket port config ineffective in Docker direct-access mode** 🐛
  - Fixed an issue where setting `WS_EXTERNAL_PORT` had no effect: the frontend still connected to the Web port instead of the configured WS port
  - Root cause: in production mode, `/_cm_ws` (using `window.location.host`, i.e. the Web port) was tried first; since Next.js has no WebSocket proxy for that path, the connection failed and fell back to HTTP polling before the direct-port URL was ever tried
  - Fix: when `runtime-config.WS_PORT` is present (i.e. `WS_EXTERNAL_PORT` is set), the direct-port URL is now preferred — no need to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` as a workaround

## [1.3.5] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **WebSocket Summary Data Enhancement** 📊
  - WebSocket broadcasts now include total proxy count and rule count in summary data
  - Refined dashboard data fetching strategy during active WebSocket connections
- **Responsive Overview List Display** 📐
  - New `useResponsiveItemCount` hook dynamically adjusts list item count based on viewport height
  - Top Domains card now includes traffic progress bars for visual proportion display
- **Country/Region Name Internationalization** 🌍
  - Replaced manually-maintained country name mappings with `Intl.DisplayNames` API, supporting localized names for all 249 ISO country codes
  - All region-related panels (overview, top list, traffic list, pie chart, world map, IP details) now display correctly localized country names
  - Custom name overrides for specific regions ensure consistent display across different browser/OS CLDR versions
- **New Logo** 🎨

### Fixed

- **Rules statistics not showing** 🐛
  - Fixed Dashboard displaying 0 for total rules and total proxies after the 1.3.4 WebSocket summary optimization
  - Root cause: `totalProxies`/`totalRules` were previously derived from `proxyStats`/`ruleStats` array lengths, but the summary optimization skipped fetching these arrays
  - Fix: moved both counts into the WebSocket summary cache so they are always available
- **Dashboard stuck in loading state during WebSocket connection**
  - Fixed Dashboard showing infinite transition animation when WebSocket was in `connecting` state
  - Refined `isTransitioning` logic to only show loading state when HTTP fallback data fetching is actually needed
- **Settings toggle switch jitter** ⚡
  - Fixed the Collect toggle and Active backend switch causing the entire backend list to flash with skeleton loading
  - Changed to silent data refresh, avoiding unnecessary full re-renders
- **Desktop dropdown menu scrollbar flicker**
  - Fixed layout shift caused by scrollbar appearing/disappearing when opening dropdown menus, dialogs, or theme switcher
  - Scrollbar space reservation now only applies on desktop (`pointer: fine`), preserving correct Radix popover positioning on mobile

## [1.3.4] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Enhanced Backend Health Monitoring** 🏥
  - Agents now report gateway latency to the collector for improved health monitoring
  - New `nekoagent restart-all` command to restart all Agent instances with one command
  - Backend health status now supports explicit state identifiers (healthy/unhealthy/unknown)
  - Health charts now auto-color based on latency: green for low, yellow for medium, red for high
  - Direct mode backends display latency curves; Agent mode backends display online/offline status
  - Gateway latency calculation algorithm optimized, chart labels localized (Chinese/English)

- **Agent Auto-Start on Boot** 🚀
  - Install script now supports system service managers for automatic Agent startup on boot
  - Supports systemd (Linux mainstream distros), launchd (macOS), OpenWrt procd, cron (universal)
  - Automatically detects system type and configures the appropriate service during installation
  - Auto-start can be disabled with `--no-autostart` flag

- **WebSocket Performance Optimization** ⚡
  - New `includeSummary` parameter for WebSocket stats to enable on-demand summary retrieval
  - Selective summary field retrieval reduces unnecessary data transmission
  - `useStableTimeRange` now rounds to the nearest minute to avoid boundary jitter
  - Granular summary data fetching with client-side caching mechanism
  - Rules Tab now displays top summary stat cards

### Changed

- Optimized `tr` command character set conversion for improved cross-platform compatibility
- Fixed redundant manager file synchronization issue

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Backend Health Monitoring Tab** 🏥
  - New dedicated Health tab for historical health status visualization across all configured backends
  - Per-backend time-series area chart: latency curve for Direct mode, online/offline status for Agent mode
  - Unhealthy and unknown periods are shaded red/amber; interior data gaps (between first and last recorded point) are automatically treated as downtime, while leading/trailing gaps remain blank
  - Multi-range support (1h / 6h / 12h / 24h / 7d / 30d) with axis label format auto-switching (time-only / month+time / date-only) based on span
  - Six summary stat cards at the top: overall uptime %, healthy backends, unhealthy backends, total backends, avg latency, bucket granularity — visual style aligned with the Overview tab
  - Health check interval defaults to 30 seconds (min 5 s), configurable via `BACKEND_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`
  - New `backend_health_logs` table keyed on `(backend_id, minute)`; multiple checks within the same minute are UPSERT-deduplicated; logs are automatically pruned on a 30-day retention schedule alongside hourly stats
  - Health history API supports filtering by `backendId`; data is grouped by backend and enriched with names in the service layer, keeping the controller as a thin routing layer
- **Country traffic connection counting**
  - Country traffic statistics now include a connections dimension; the Country Traffic panel supports sort-by-connections
  - Agent report payloads include an explicit `connections` field with legacy-compatible fallback
- **Time range preset expansion**
  - `5m` and `30m` quick presets are now available in production environments

### Changed

- **Traffic collection connection counting aligned**
  - Both Agent and Direct modes now count connections once per flush interval, eliminating duplicate increments
  - Removed the connection count accumulation side-effect from the legacy `requeueFront` retry path
- **Case normalization function compatibility**
  - `tr`-based character class conversions replaced with explicit character lists for consistent cross-platform behavior

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **ClickHouse high-performance storage backend (major update)** 🗄️
  - Added ClickHouse as an optional analytics storage engine, forming a dual-write architecture alongside SQLite
  - Health-aware write routing: SQLite stats writes are automatically skipped when ClickHouse is healthy, significantly reducing local disk I/O
  - ClickHouse-exclusive mode available for large-scale multi-agent deployments
  - New `ClickHouseWriter` module with batched writes, health monitoring, consecutive-failure fallback, and graceful recovery
- **`NEKO_AGENT_REF` branch testing support**
  - Added `NEKO_AGENT_REF` environment variable to the install script to download `nekoagent` from any GitHub branch
  - E.g. `NEKO_AGENT_REF=refactor/clickhouse` lets you test pre-release branches without modifying the script

### Performance

- **Agent report traffic gzip compression (~10-15x ratio)** 🚀
  - All `neko-agent` HTTP report requests are now gzip-compressed; overnight upload traffic reduced from ~4 GB to ~300 MB
  - Collector transparently decompresses via Fastify `preParsing` hook with no new dependencies
  - Fully backward-compatible: older uncompressed `neko-agent` versions continue to work alongside compressed ones

### Fixed

- **[P0] ClickHouse health check used wrong method, causing silent data loss**
  - Fixed `shouldSkipSqliteStatsWrites` in `app.ts` incorrectly calling `clickHouseWriter.isEnabled()` instead of `clickHouseWriter.isHealthy()`
  - When ClickHouse has consecutive write failures it now correctly falls back to SQLite writes, preventing silent data loss
- **[P1] Agent retry lost requestId, causing duplicate traffic counting**
  - Agent report payload now includes a `requestId` (32-char hex generated via `crypto/rand`)
  - Collector implements server-side idempotency dedup (5-minute TTL Map); duplicate `requestId` arrivals are silently discarded
  - Fixed the old `requeueFront` pattern where re-queuing a failed batch assigned it a new ID, allowing the same data to be counted twice; failed batches now carry the same `requestId` for the entire retry window

### Changed

- **`nekoagent update` / `upgrade` completely rewritten**
  - The old `update` command was re-running the install script and invoking `nekoagent add` — it never actually updated the binary
  - Rewritten to download the target version directly, SHA256-verify it, and replace the installed binary in-place; skips download when already at target version
  - Added `upgrade` as an alias for `update`
- **`nekoagent add` auto-starts by default**
  - `auto_start` default changed from `false` to `true`; instances now start automatically after `add` without requiring a manual `start`
  - Added `--no-start` flag to suppress auto-start when needed
  - Install script `NEKO_AUTO_START=false` now correctly passes `--no-start` through to the `add` command
- **Unified agent versioning**
  - `neko-agent` binary version is now injected at build time via ldflags (`-X ...config.AgentVersion=<tag>`), replacing the previous hardcoded constant
  - CI `agent-release.yml` automatically extracts and injects the version from the git tag; local dev builds report `dev`
  - `nekoagent version` now displays both the manager script version and the `neko-agent` binary version together for consistent version visibility
- **Install script incremental version detection**
  - When an existing installation is detected, the script queries the GitHub Releases API to determine the latest remote version
  - If local version matches the target: skip download and call `nekoagent add` directly; otherwise update the binary first, then add the instance

### Documentation

- **`docs/` directory reorganization**
  - Added `docs/dev/` (ClickHouse analysis and refactor docs) and `docs/research/` (model research reports) subdirectories
  - Added `docs/README.md` (Chinese doc index) and `docs/README.en.md` (English doc index) with categorized clickable links
  - Fixed broken Agent doc links in `README.en.md` that pointed to Chinese `.md` files instead of `.en.md`
  - Architecture guide updated with a dedicated Agent mode section covering deployment topology and data flow

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- Refactored backend UX for Agent: add/edit moved into dialogs, action row alignment improved
- Improved Agent Script modal responsiveness and scroll behavior for mobile/smaller viewports
- Locked gateway type (Clash/Surge) after creation to prevent destructive mode mutation

### Security

- Agent token is now system-managed: historical tokens are not re-shown; rotation generates new random token
- Added backend token binding guard: one token cannot be reused by multiple `agentId` values

### Compatibility

- Added protocol/version gate support with `MIN_AGENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION` and `MIN_AGENT_VERSION`
- Incompatible requests now return explicit codes:

  - Added `packages/shared/src/geo-ip-utils.ts` and unified `normalizeGeoIP` usage across frontend/backend
  - Narrowed `IPStats.geoIP` to a structured object type and removed array-shape dependency
  - Applied normalization consistently in collector IP-related query outputs for backward compatibility
- **Config module refactor**
  - Moved `/api/db/*` routes out of `app.ts` into a dedicated `config.controller`
  - Added `autoListen` option to `createApp` for better testability and controlled startup
- **GeoIP service reliability improvements**
  - Reused MMDB required-file constants to avoid hardcoded filenames
  - Added short TTL cache for MMDB missing-file checks to reduce repeated filesystem probes
  - Added queue-overflow logging and `destroy()` resource cleanup

- **Fixed Windows flag emoji rendering in React Flow chain nodes**
  - Applied `emoji-flag-font` to rule/group/proxy node labels
  - Unified active-link key encoding across backend/frontend to avoid ambiguous link matching

## [1.2.9] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Offline GeoIP lookup via local MMDB** 🌐
  - Added IP lookup source switching in Settings (`online` / `local`)
  - Added support for local MMDB files: `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`, `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb` (required), `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` (optional)
- **MMDB preflight checks and safeguards**
  - Required MMDB files are validated before enabling local mode
  - Local option is disabled when required files are missing, with missing-file hints in UI
- **MMDB availability fallback safeguards**
  - If MMDB files are removed, runtime lookup now falls back to online API automatically
  - If config is still `local` while MMDB is unavailable, backend auto-reverts persisted provider to `online` to keep UI and runtime behavior consistent
- **Improved local development MMDB directory detection**
  - Improved MMDB directory resolution with multiple candidates and env override support
  - Fixed the case where Local could not be enabled even though MMDB files existed in local development
- **Unified mobile details interaction**
  - Rules page (Domains / IPs) now uses Drawer for mobile details
  - Mobile details behavior is aligned with devices and stats pages
- **Improved settings interaction consistency**
  - `IP Lookup Source` selected-state visuals are now consistent with the Favicon selector
  - Options are now fully row-clickable instead of requiring direct radio-button clicks

### Changed

  - Added clearer local MMDB deployment and mount instructions
  - Clarified that `GEOIP_ONLINE_API_URL` is intended for endpoints compatible with the `ipinfo.my` response schema
  - Consolidated duplicate English README entry points

## [1.2.8] - 2026-02-15

### Performance

- **Up to 60x query performance improvement** 🚀
  - Added `hourly_dim_stats` / `hourly_country_stats` pre-aggregation tables, maintained in real-time on write
  - All dimension queries (domain/ip/proxy/rule/device/country) automatically route to hourly pre-aggregated tables for ranges > 6h
  - Timeseries query optimization: `getHourlyStats`, `getTrafficInRange`, `getTrafficTrend`, `getTrafficTrendAggregated` now read directly from `hourly_stats` for long-range queries instead of scanning and re-aggregating `minute_stats`
  - 7-day range queries reduced from ~10,080 rows scanned to ~168 rows
  - Per WebSocket broadcast total row scans reduced from ~20,160 to ~336
- **`resolveFactTableSplit` hybrid query strategy**: Long-range queries split into hourly (completed hours) + minute (current hour tail) for both performance and precision

### Added

- **Testing Infrastructure** 🧪
  - Introduced Vitest framework with unit tests for `traffic-writer`, `auth.service`, and `stats.service`
  - Added test helpers (`helpers.ts`)
  - Added ESLint configuration and `.env.example`
- **Time Range Picker Enhancements**
  - Added "1 hour" quick preset, replacing the default 30-minute view
  - Added "Today" quick option for trend charts (midnight to current time)
  - Moved 30-minute preset to debug short presets list
- **`BatchBuffer` module**: Standalone batch buffering module, decoupled from collector

### Fixed

- **Cookie authentication security**: Changed `secure` flag from `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` to `request.protocol === 'https'`, fixing login loop on HTTP intranet environments where cookies could not be set
- **Windows emoji flag display**: Added `emoji-flag-font` CSS class to proxy-related components (list, chart, grid, interactive stats, rule stats) to fix broken flag emoji rendering on Windows

### Refactored

- **Global AuthGuard refactoring**: Extracted authentication logic from dashboard layout into a standalone `AuthGuard` component, simplified `auth.tsx` and `auth-queries.ts`
- **Collector service decomposition**: Significantly slimmed down `collector.ts` and `surge-collector.ts` by extracting `BatchBuffer` and `RealtimeStore` modules
- Removed legacy `api.ts` entry file, unified to modular controllers

### Technical Details

- `hourly_dim_stats` schema: `(backend_id, hour, dimension, dim_key, upload, download, connections)`, updated in real-time via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
- `resolveFactTable` / `resolveFactTableSplit` methods implemented in `BaseRepository`, shared across all repositories
- Timeseries query thresholds: `getTrafficInRange`/`getTrafficTrend` switch to `hourly_stats` at > 6h; `getTrafficTrendAggregated` switches when `bucketMinutes >= 60`
- Seamless upgrade: new tables auto-created via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, existing `minute_dim_stats` data backfilled to hourly tables on first startup

- **Cleanup timer determinism**: Changed `recentlyCompleted` cleanup from `setInterval` to deterministic triggering tied to the polling cycle
- Fixed IPv6 validation logic using Node.js native `net.isIPv4/isIPv6`

### Refactored

- **Database Repository Pattern Refactoring** 🏗️
  - Split the 5400+ line monolithic `db.ts` into 14 independent Repository files
  - Added `database/repositories/` directory with Repository Pattern architecture
  - Slimmed `db.ts` down to ~1000 lines, retaining only DDL, migrations, and one-line delegation methods
  - Extracted Repositories: `base`, `domain`, `ip`, `rule`, `proxy`, `device`, `country`, `timeseries`, `traffic-writer`, `config`, `backend`, `auth`, `surge`
  - `BaseRepository` encapsulates 13 shared utility methods including `parseMinuteRange`, `expandShortChainsForRules`, etc.
